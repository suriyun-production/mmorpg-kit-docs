## 1.95 (2025-07-14)
### LiteNetLibManager Changes
- `LiteNetLibSyncField` workflow changes, it will sync data unreliably when changes occurs then send packed reliably later if no changes occurs, it is faster than send reliably for all changes becasuse it doesn't have to wait to reorder before proceeding, so delivery method setting is removed.
- Tick sync implemented, will gradually change hit registration, hitboxes rewinding, entity movement by using tick later.
- Add `IsReliableOnly` to `ITransport` interface, use it to determine how to handle things if transport is reliable only (transport like WebSocket).

- Add `detectionMode` option to `SafeArea` component, it was detect by interface, which can determine that the object is enter safe area when its hitbox enter the area, so I add this option to detect by damageable component or interface.
- Add `groundFindingType` option to detect grounded position to `GameArea` (base of spawn areas), can detect grounded position by navmesh -> position sample, or physic raycasting.
- Add `randomPositionAmount`, `randomPositionSeed`, `randomSpacing` options for positions baking to `GameArea`, try setup it and press `Bake Random Positions` button, then you will positions in `randomedPosition3Ds`/`randomedPosition2Ds` and on scene gizmos.

### New Features
Entity setting, scriptable object class: You may create a new class by extending `BaseEntitySetting` class and implementing functions to change required components, its setup.

### UIDragHandler Change
Now `UIDragHandler` is changed, it won't move its parent to another but it will tell `UIDragManager` to create a `UIDragFakeTarget` instance for dragging, the `UIDragFakeTarget` instance will have only `Image` component attached for the icon, no other texts/objects components included.
The new setup won't required UI cloning, it is unlike how we setup previously draggable UI which we have to create a new instance which will clone data from the source UI instance with drag handler component attached, we can just attach a drag handler directly to the source UI instance.

## 1.88e (2024-05-15)
### Bug Fixes
- Amount of gold is `0` when entering the game while `GameInstance` -> `GoldStoreMode` is `Default`.
- Invalid RTT calculation if server/client is in a different time zone.

### Improvements
- Add `ExpTable` scriptable object, you can store an amount of EXP for level up here.
- Add `GameInstance` -> `ExpTable`, if it is not set (being `NULL` or empty) the old `ExpTree` configs will be migrated to be `ExpTable` when starting a game.
- Add `SocialSystemSetting` -> `GuildExpTable`, if it is not set (being `NULL` or empty) the old `GuildExpTree` configs will be migrated to be `GuildExpTable` when starting a game.
- Add `BaseCharacter` -> `ExpTable` configs, you can set created `ExpTable` here to use the table instead of `GameInstance` -> `ExpTable`.

* * *

## 1.88d (2024-05-12)

## 1.88c (2024-05-06)
### New Features
- `RigidBodyEntityMovement2D` force applying.
- `NavMeshEntityMovement` force applying.

### Bug Fixes
- [2464](https://github.com/suriyun-production/mmorpg-kit-docs/issues/2464)

* * *

## 1.88b (2024-05-04)
### New Features
- Add `Immediately` to `GameInstance` -> `monsterDeadDropItemMode`, use it if you want to send items to player's inventory immediately as a reward when monster is killed.
- Add `GameInstance` -> `goldStoreMode` setting, set it to `UserGoldOnly` to make it use only user gold (not character gold) to store gold.

### Improvements
- Change prefab usage priority, now priority is prefab > addressable prefab. Why? because if you set prefab then it will be loaded when the scene loads so it doesn't have to load later like addressable asset one, so it has no advantage to load addressable assets if prefabs were set.

* * *

## 1.88 (2024-05-01)
### New Features
- Addressable Assets integration (not 100% done yet).
- Guild joining request (not the invitation to join guild).

- [2450](https://github.com/suriyun-production/mmorpg-kit-docs/issues/2450)
- Item amount not being updated properly when dealing items with another player.

### Improvements
- [2451](https://github.com/suriyun-production/mmorpg-kit-docs/issues/2451)
- Reduce memory leak, by clear ref to Unity Objects when mono behaviour being destroyed, it can reduce amount of [Leaked Managed Shells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwQmpQTtA4).
- Change how character relates data being cached, change them to be a structs then store them into cache manager which can be cleared by interval, to make sure that it won't create a new cache the data that already cached.
- Add `No Slot Usage` to item data settings, while this is `TRUE` inventory/storage won't count it, you can use it for item like skin items.
- Add `Equippable Slot Indexes` to weapon item data settings, usage example: If you want to make assult rifle to be equippable on 1st and 2nd weapon sets, set this to [0, 1]. If you want to make Pistol to be equippable on 3rd weapon set, set this to [2].  Each weapon set contains slots for right-hand and left-hand. Useful for shooter game, for an RPG games, set it to be empty.
- Change `UNITY_SERVER` conditions to `!EXCLUDE_SERVER_CODES`, use it to exclude server codes from build (you can use `MMORPG KIT` menu to do it), I decides to change it because it is hard to work with when I try to exclude client codes (such as audio/particles playing which should be excluded from server).

* * *

## 1.87 (2024-02-05)
### New Features
- Logging component interface (You will have to implement it by yourself) [306](https://github.com/suriyun-production/mmorpg-kit-docs/issues/306)

- Implement [2110](https://github.com/suriyun-production/mmorpg-kit-docs/issues/2110), [More info](../pages/164-custom-quest-task-description.md)
- [2093](https://github.com/suriyun-production/mmorpg-kit-docs/issues/2093)
- Change physic transforms syncing workflow, to make it sync manually in `BaseGameNetworkManager.Update()`, have to set `BaseGameNetworkManager.ShouldPhysicSyncTransforms` or `BaseGameNetworkManager.ShouldPhysicSyncTransforms2D` to sync transforms in that frame, it will do transforms syncing after network events proceeded and before entities updating.
- Change speed hack validate workflow, for 3D entity movement, it will validate horizontal and vertical movement separately.
- Make speed hack validate more accurate (hope it won't cause any new bugs :P).
- Clear character caches when character entity destroy, when character data destructed.

- [2070](https://github.com/suriyun-production/mmorpg-kit-docs/issues/2070)

### Performance Improvements
- Change game entity updating to be updated by a manager (`BaseGameNetworkManager`), it will register entity to update when entity component is started, and unregister when destroy. In-case you want to understand how it work, read [this](https://blog.unity.com/engine-platform/10000-update-calls).
- Remove `FixedUpdate` from game entity, so the `onFixedUpdate` event will also be removed too.
- Reduce monster's enemy finding frequency, because it is finding by [Physics.OverlapSphere](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Physics.OverlapSphere.html) every frames, so I reduce it.
- Prepare hitbox bounds immediately when it is instantiated instead of recalculate everytime when storing to history collection. But it will only supports following colliders: `BoxCollider`, `SphereCollider`, `BoxCollider2D` and `CircleCollider2D`.
- Add `updateAnimationAtServer` to `GameInstance`, can turn it off to not play animations on server, if you don't making shooter games, which character's hitboxes will be moved follow character's animation, you should turn it off.

### Improvements
- Rework on `HitRegistrationManager`, change its workflow, make it work with `MissileDamageEntity`.

### Changes
- `DamageableHitBox` is only supports following colliders: `BoxCollider`, `SphereCollider`, `BoxCollider2D` and `Rigidbody2D`.
- Remove `standaloneVSyncCount` setting from `GameInstance`, it is not neccessary for game networking and conflicting with graphic settings.
- Remove `standaloneTargetFrameRate` setting from `GameInstance`, it is not neccessary for game networking and conflicting with graphic settings.
- Remove `mobileVSyncCount` setting from `GameInstance`, it is not neccessary for game networking and conflicting with graphic settings.
- Remove `mobileTargetFrameRate` setting from `GameInstance`, it is not neccessary for game networking and conflicting with graphic settings.
- Remove `consoleVSyncCount` setting from `GameInstance`, it is not neccessary for game networking and conflicting with graphic settings.
- Remove `consoleTargetFrameRate` setting from `GameInstance`, it is not neccessary for game networking and conflicting with graphic settings.

## 1.83c (2023-05-03)
### Bug Fixes
- [2049](https://github.com/suriyun-production/mmorpg-kit-docs/issues/2049)

### Improvements
- Add `showAllWhenNoTrackedQuests` to `UICharacterQuests`, you can turn it off if you feel that [this](https://github.com/suriyun-production/mmorpg-kit-docs/issues/2060) is a bug.
- Add `isLocked` to `Faction` data, turn it on if you don't want to show it in character creating faction list.
- Add `changeCharacterFaction` to `Quest` data, when character finish the quest it will change faction to this value.
- Add `enterDialogActionOnClient` and `enterDialogActionOnServer` to `BaseNpcDialog`, you can set action when enter the NPC dialog here, but before you can do this you have to make classes based on `BaseNpcDialogAction` and implement `DoAction` function, then you can implement any actions as you wish, you may give gold, exp, teleport, change respawn point, and so on when enter the NPC dialog.

## 1.83 (2023-04-29)
### Bug Fixes
- [2048](https://github.com/suriyun-production/mmorpg-kit-docs/issues/2048)

### Improvements
- Stop entity's updating when there is no subscribers [video](https://youtu.be/3LV7KpP1MaM).
- Make MMO codes shareable with other C# projects, so you won't have to build server projects with Unity, It can speed up your server development, also may improve performance, but you still have to use Unity to build a map-server. You can develop Login, Character Management, Scene Management and Database Management systems outside of Unity [video](https://youtu.be/xiuTKrKzf5w), You can see the .NET console project [here](https://github.com/insthync/UnityMultiplayerARPG_MMO.NET.git).

### Improvements
- Move entity movement codes to `BuiltInEntityMovementFunctions3D` class, `CharacterControllerEntityMovement`, `RigidBodyEntityMovement`, and `KCCEntityMovement` are using the same codes, just use different motor, so I move it.

### Guild War Service
- Guild War Service is implemented, you can see the service part [here](https://github.com/insthync/mmorpg-kit-guild-war-service)
- Guild castle occupying data will be stored into database by this service. So when the server restarted, occupied castles data won't be lost.
- Add custom NPC dialog condition: `DefenderGuildNpcDialogCondition` use it to show menu for defender guild members only, can use it to show menu to warp members to defend the castle.

### New Custom Npc Dialog Condition
- Add new kind of `Condition Type`: `Custom By Scripting Object`.
- You can create custom condition by create a new class which extends `BaseCustomNpcDialogCondition` (can see `DefenderGuildNpcDialogCondition` as example).
- `IsPass` function in `BaseCustomNpcDialogCondition` can be async function, so we can connect to service/server to bring data to check condition asynchronously.
- Old custom condition type which uses serialized callback data still there, I actually want to change parameter from character's ID to pass full character's data but I am afraid that it will break someone's projects.

### Bug Fixes
- [2017](https://github.com/suriyun-production/mmorpg-kit-docs/issues/2017)

### Improvements
- Add `doNotUseEntityBones` to equipment item -> `EquipmentModel`, turn it on to not use bones from entity if this mesh is skinned mesh.
- Add `doNotChangeScale` to equipment item -> `EquipmentModel`, turn it on to not change object scale when it is instantiated to character's hands (or other part of body)

* * *

## 1.82c (2023-04-14)
### Gradually Made Changes to Code Conventions
I've gradually made changes to code conventions
- `private`/`protected` field name are `camelCase` which prefixed with `_`.
- But `private`/`protected` serialized field will not prefixed with `_`.
- `private`/`protected` static field name are `camelCase` which prefixed with `s_`.
- All properties are `PascalCase`.
- All functions are `PascalCase`.
It may affect some of your addons codes (As I found, it will affect player character controller, character model, entity movement codes) but it is not hard to fix, just change variable names by add `_` prefix, or change first property name character to be upper-case.

### Database Service which runs externally from Unity instance
Now the database service which runs externally from Unity instance is able to use, you can get it from [this repo](https://github.com/insthync/UnityMultiplayerARPG_DatabaseManager)
it is not production ready yet, I want to make it more secured because in the current version, anyone can access to the service.

If you want to try it, you have to set `Custom Database Client Source` in `MMO Server Instance`, you can see how I set it up in the `00Init_MMO` -> `MMOServerInstance` game object. then after the server built, you have to turn `useCustomDatabaseClient` on, by add config to server config file as: `"useCustomDatabaseClient": true`.

I will write more info as an documents later (maybe next Monday).

### Improvements
- [1905](https://github.com/suriyun-production/mmorpg-kit-docs/issues/1905) - I've added `disallowSprint`, `disallowWalk`, `disallowJump`, `disallowCrouch`, and `disallowCrawl` to `Buff` data, but the old `disallowMove` will still disallow all movement.
- [1944](https://github.com/suriyun-production/mmorpg-kit-docs/issues/1944) - I've added `ItemRandomByWeightTable`, create this data, and set it to `MonsterCharacter` -> `itemRandomByWeightTables` to make it able to random items by weighted items table.
- Include [UnityRestClient](https://github.com/insthync/unity-rest-client.git) to the core.

- [1952](https://github.com/suriyun-production/mmorpg-kit-docs/issues/1952)

### Improvements
- Add `doNotRandomAnimation` and `animationResetDelay` settings to `DefaultCharacterAttackComponent`. `DefaultCharacterAttackComponent` is component which attached to character entity to handle character's attacking, those settings were made for developer who want to make the character plays animation sequently by set `doNotRandomAnimation` to `TRUE` and then if your character have 3 animations it will play from 1 to 3 not random, and `animationResetDelay` is delay before reset the sequence for example if you set it to `2` seconds, then if your character's attacking animation `#2` ended at `30` and no attacking before `32`, then when attack again it will start play attacking animation `#1` because it was reset.

* * *

## 1.81d (2023-03-16)
### Improvements
- Improve sheath/unsheath animation playing, when unequip the item it will play sheath animation not unsheath one.
- Improve sheath/unsheath animation playing, add and implements shield sheathing animations setting: `leftHandShieldSheathingAnimation` to `DefaultAnimations`.
- Change sheath/unsheath animation settings variable names: `rightHandHolsterAnimation` -> `rightHandWeaponSheathingAnimation`, `leftHandHolsterAnimation` -> `leftHandWeaponSheathingAnimation`, `holsterState` -> `sheathState`, `holsteredDurationRate` -> `sheathedDurationRate`, `drawState` -> `unsheathState`, and `drawnDurationRate` -> `unsheathedDurationRate`.
- Improve battle point calculation, by including equipped weapons's pure damage.
- Add `UIItemRandomBonus` component, use it to show available list of equipment item's bonus that can be randomed, create it and set it to `UICharacterItem` -> `uiItemRandomBonus`.

* * *

## 1.81c (2023-03-14)
### New Feature: Battle Point
Battle point can be calculated by amount of `Attribute`, `Resistance`, `Armor`, `Damage`, `Skill` and `Character Stats`
You can change amount of score in:
- `Attribute` game data -> `battlePointScore`.
- `Skill` game data -> `battlePointScore`.
- `DamageElement` game data -> `resistanceBattlePointScore`.
- `DamageElement` game data -> `armorBattlePointScore`.
- `DamageElement` game data -> `damageBattlePointScore`.
- `DefaultGameplayRule` game data -> in `Battle Points Score` section.

### New Feature: Item expiring
You can make an items expired by duration which set to `Item` game data -> `expireDuration`,
if you set this value to `7` then when your character earn the item it will be expired and removed from inventory in next `7` hours.

### Bug Fixes
- [1945](https://github.com/suriyun-production/mmorpg-kit-docs/issues/1945)
- [1947](https://github.com/suriyun-production/mmorpg-kit-docs/issues/1947)

### Improvements
I gradually move some character relates data codes to shared data repositories, I will make those repo to be public later, I hope that other developers can use them to develop web services/APIs part,
I will make a new database management service based on that too, as an example.

* * *

## 1.81b (2023-03-09)
### Bug Fixes
- [1939](https://github.com/suriyun-production/mmorpg-kit-docs/issues/1939)
- [1934](https://github.com/suriyun-production/mmorpg-kit-docs/issues/1934)

### Improvements
- Add `uiNotBlockForStandalone`, `uiNotBlockForMobile`, and `uiNotBlockForConsole` settings to `PlayerCharacterController`, set it to `TRUE` to make it don't block controlling while any of `UIBlockController` component enabled, it might sounds not make sense because you guys should just remove the component to make it don't block controlling, but after I saw a customer report about it as a [bug](https://github.com/suriyun-production/mmorpg-kit-docs/issues/1941) then I have to add those conditional variables.
- Add some delay to `EventSystemManager` to make sure that the event system will be setup properly.
- Update console UI controlling demo, add hotkey UIs.
- Update console UI controlling demo, add event to select UIs after end editing input field, so I didn't make any changes to input field codes, just set on end edit event.

* * *

## 1.81 (2023-03-02)
### New Feature: UIs Controlling for Console platforms
To test it you should change active input handling to be `Input System`.
Then change game instance's `Test In Editor Mode` setting in init scene to `Console`.
I've made the character management demo for Offline/LAN game only, so you can try it from `00Init` scene.

Because Unity's UI's navigation not good enough for me, so I have to make new UI components that you can find in `Assets/UnityMultiplayerARPG/Core/Scripts/UI/Selectables`.
You can set multiple selectables as navigation target (`upSelectables`, `downSelectables`, `leftSelectables`, `rightSelectables`) in those components, so if any selectables are inactive it can use another in the selectable list.
I also improve workflow for scroll rect to snap to those components, if you select it (any instance of those components) while it is not fully visible in scroll rect area it will move scroll rect's content transform to show it.

I also made navigation making components `NavigationGroup` and `NavigationChild`, when `NavigationGroup` add `NavigationChild` it will make navigation target for `NavigationChild` so you won't have to setup navigation target, it will be done automatically.

I don't plan to make all UIs for console platforms, just plan to make a demo to show that it is working in most case, console UIs controlling are just about navigation setup, you just have to setup it properly.
I've added new components which improve Unity's components and I think it is enough for console UIs making, but it's not 100% yet, Unity's input field navigation not working properly, I will fix it later.
I don't know that Unity's new UI system (UI Elements/UI Toolkit) have better navigation system or not, I didn't try it yet.

## 1.80c2 (2023-02-10)
### Bug Fixes
- [1892](https://github.com/suriyun-production/mmorpg-kit-docs/issues/1892)

## 1.80c (2023-02-06)
### Bug Fixes
- [1890](https://github.com/suriyun-production/mmorpg-kit-docs/issues/1890)
- [1891](https://github.com/suriyun-production/mmorpg-kit-docs/issues/1891)

### Improvements
- Remove `failChance` from buff data, and add `enableApplyChance` and `applyChance` to buff data, because I think `applyChance` is makes more sense than `failChance`, must has a `enableApplyChance` because buff data from an older version has no apply chance to setup, it is always 100% applying, so to not break other customer projects, I've decided to add `enableApplyChance`, set it to `TRUE` to make it applying buff by `applyChance`, otherwise it will 100% applying buff.
- Add `removeBuffWhenAttackChance`, `removeBuffWhenAttackedChance`, `removeBuffWhenUseSkillChance`, `removeBuffWhenUseItemChance`, and `removeBuffWhenPickupItemChance` to buff data, use it to set chance to remove buff, for an example case if you want your character stop hiding when attacking an enemies, you may set `removeBuffWhenAttackChance` base value to `1` to make it remove the hide buff from your character.

## 1.78 (2022-10-15)
### Movement Secure Setting Changes
The movement secure setting was moved to the entity movement component because while it is stored in the game entity component it feels like it will be able to set movement secure for any entity movement components, and I have to implement both server auth and client auth movement in each component, which I feel not convenience to implements entity movement with it because it has to use the setting as a condition to implements entity movement. I feel more convenient with one component for a specific movement secure setting, so in the future, it will be easier to implement new entity movement.

* * *

## 1.75 (2022-05-03)
### Add chat bubble
Add `UIChatBubbleManager` component which you may attach it to the same game object with `UISceneGameplay` prefab. It will instantiates `UIChatMessage` by prefabs that being set in `UIChatBubbleManager` to `PlayerCharacterEntity` -> `chatBubbleTransform`.
So you will have to set `PlayerCharacterEntity` -> `chatBubbleTransform` too, create a child transform and may set it above of your character's head and set that transform to the reference field.

### Skill requirement structure changes
With the old skill requirement, we can't set vary `attributeAmounts` and `skillLevels` for each level, so I change structure to make it able to do it, by add `requirementEachLevels` to `BaseSkill` it is array of requirement each level.
But still keep old skill requirement as a tool for generate a new `requirementEachLevels` list.

## 1.74 (2022-04-18)
### Entity State Syncing Changes
In this version, entity state syncing was changed, now client will send movement input, and action input (such as attack/use skill/reload) at the same time then when the server receive input from client it will process it and sync updated state later.

### Hit Registration Changes
In this version client will tell server when sphere cast hit or raycast hit other damageable entity (when missile damage entity hit still same with the old version) then server will validate it by roll back hitboxes based on client RTT, I did it to improve players experience, if you want to change how it register hit and validate, you can create class which implements `IHitRegistrationManager` (you can look at `DefaultHitRegistrationManager` to see how I implement it) and attach to the same game object with map network manager (`LanRpgNetworkManager`/`MapNetworkManager`) to use it.

### Dev Extension Methods Changes
I've added `GameExtensionInstance` class, we will use it to extend some functionality without core's codes changes because it will contain static delegate functions which will be invoked by other parts, for now, it have `onAddCharacterStats`, `onMultiplyCharacterStatsWithNumber`, `onMultiplyCharacterStats` and `onRandomCharacterStats` delegates. I also remove `CharacterStats` dev extension methods invoking and using the mentioned delegates functions to improve performance, you can see how to extend it in `DevExtDemo_GameExtensionInstance` and `DevExtDemo_CharacterStats`.

### Missile Damage Entity Changes
Now missile damage entity will use physics casting functions instead of collider component with trigger events, you can set `hitDetectionMode` to `Raycast` or `SphereCast` or `BoxCast`, it will casting from current position to last frame position to find hitting objects. In this version also have `ProjectileDamageEntity` which made by `moepi2k` added.

### Minimap Improvement
In this version, you can make minimap texture by using a tool that will capture images from the opened scene, you can access the tool from menu `MMORPG KIT/Minimap Creator` or by a component named `MinimapCreator`. The captured minimap texture will be used by `MinimapRenderer` component which is a component that will create `SpriteRenderer` and set the minimap texture as its rendering sprite. So now it can render minimap without rendering all map objects by just rendering the minimap sprite but you still have to set the minimap camera's culling mask to show the minimap sprite renderer and other minimap objects (such as character markers). The `MinimapRenderer` will be attached to `MinimapCamera` in the demo.

### Auto Use Potion Item Setting
In this version, I've added `AutoUseKey` to `IPotionItem` so you can set key to potion items, the key will being used by `AutoUsePotion` component to use potion automatically by defined condition. For example, if you have `HpPotionItem`, its `AutoUseKey` is `HpPotion`. Then in `AutoUsePotion` component, its `conditionType` is `Hp`, its `useWhenRateLessThan` is `0.5`, its `key` is `HpPotionItem`. Then while playing, if your character's HP < 50% it will use `HpPotionItem`.

- Add `startAttackDistance` setting to `DamageInfo`, it is a distance to start an attack, this does NOT distance to hit and apply damage, this value should be less than `hitDistance` or `missileDistance` to make sure it will hit the enemy properly. If this value <= 0 or > `hitDistance` or `missileDistance` it will re-calculate by `hitDistance` or `missileDistance`

## 1.67c (2021-08-05)

### Bug Fixes
- Fix wrong SQLite -> Mail columns reading.
- Fix missing fields in character model component inspector.
- Fix animator character models play the same action animation like the one which played action animation lastly. 

### About Animator Character Model
I've fixed its issues by bringing back old animator character model codes which won't cache animator controller by character prefab, so it will slow because it has to create a new animator controller for all characters, the cached version has an action animation problem because the cached animator controller will be shared for all character. I can keep using the cached version but I have to create new states in animator controllers, but I'm not sure about the number of states which included attacking, reloading, skill casting, charging animations yet. So I decide to use the old version, if Unity allows me to add new animator states dynamically at runtime or has a function which just play any animation it will be easier to solve these issues.

Unity just has a [playable graph](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Playables-Graph.html) in 2018.4, which I am going to use to create a new kind of character model component, maybe named "PlayableGraphCharacterModel", can handles all animation by codes, so you won't have a graph editor like animator controller editor if you want to change transitions you may have to changes codes.

I've tried to mix animator and playable graph by uses a playable graph for action animation playing but the result was not looking good. It won't play masked avatar parts as intended.

## 1.63 (2021-03-06)
### New Systems
- Add new damage type: `Throwable` with new damage entity: `ThrowableDamageEntity`. Can use it to make grenade weapons. *`ThrowableDamageEntity` physics simulating won't synced from server yet, so players can see difference entity's position but damage still applies at server.*
- Add new fire type: `FireOnRelease` to weapon item data which will be used by `ShooterPlayerCharacterController`, it will start firing when release *attack* button.
- Add weapon charge animation which will plays while holding *attack* button (while weapon's fire type is `FireOnRelease`). *To whom who made custom animator controller, you have to add new state which its clip name must be `__WeaponCharge` and must have `IsWeaponCharge` boolean parameter and use it and transition to weapon charge state*. *In the future I might make damage varying by charge duration :P*.
- Add queueable crafting system, when you want new item craft formula you can create new `ItemCraftFormula` scriptable objects and put it to your game database.

- When character hiding, other clients will unsubscribe that character.

### Entity Movement Changes
- If `MovementSecure` is `ServerAuthoritative` it will simulate movement immediately at owner-client. Owner-client will send inputs to server (not position/rotation) then the server will simulate movement and sync transform to all clients, including owner-client in-case owner-client is lag it can cause rubber banding effect to make its transform not too difference with the server. It will set owner-client's character's transform to the one which received from server when distance is > `SnapThreshold`.
- If `MovementSecure` is `NotSecure` it will send transform to server then server pass transform to all clients like mentioned above. It can reduce work at server. But it is able to hack, I will implement speed hack detection at server later.
- It uses character's movespeed for interpolation, not estimating speed.
- It won't uses `LiteNetLibTransform` anymore, you can remove that component from your character entity. *`LiteNetLibTransform` will be disabled on awake if it can find that it has that component attached*.
